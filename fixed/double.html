    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>At Save the Puppies, our mission is to rescue homeless puppies and provide them with the care, love, and support they need until we can place them in their forever homes. We believe every puppy deserves a chance at happiness, regardless of their start in life.</p>
    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <p>To rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome puppies in need. To educate the community about responsible pet ownership. To advocate for the welfare of all animals.</p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>We partner with local shelters to identify puppies in need of rescue. Through the support of our volunteers and donors, we provide medical care, training, and love to these puppies. Once they are ready, we match them with loving families through our adoption process.</p>
