            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Save the Puppies, our mission is to provide a safe haven for puppies without homes and to find loving, permanent families for them. We believe every puppy deserves a chance at a happy life, and we work tirelessly to make that a reality.</p>

        <div class="goal-list">
            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rescue and rehabilitate puppies in need.</li>
                <li>Provide medical care, shelter, and love to every puppy in our care.</li>
                <li>Find suitable forever homes through responsible adoption practices.</li>
                <li>Educate the community about responsible pet ownership and the importance of spaying/neutering.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>1. Rescue: We partner with shelters, animal control facilities, and individuals to rescue puppies from various situations, including abandonment, neglect, and abuse.</p>
            <p>2. Rehabilitate: Once rescued, each puppy receives necessary medical care, vaccinations, and behavioral training to prepare them for adoption.</p>
            <p>3. Adoption: We carefully screen potential adopters to ensure each puppy is placed in a loving, responsible home where they will be treated as a valued family member.</p>
