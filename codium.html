    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At Save the Puppies, our mission is to take in puppies with no homes and find them forever homes. We believe that every puppy deserves a loving home, and we work tirelessly to ensure this happens.</p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <p>We strive to provide a safe and loving environment for the puppies in our care. We offer a variety of services, including puppy socialization, training, and medical care. We also work closely with potential adopters to ensure that they are prepared for the responsibilities of ownership.</p>

    <h2>Website Features</h2>
    <p>Our website is designed to provide easy access to all the information you need about our organization. We have a section dedicated to adoptable puppies, with detailed profiles and photos. We also offer a blog where we share our latest news and updates about the puppies in our care.</p>
